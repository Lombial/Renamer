# Renamer
Adds command `/changename` (`/cname`) to change your own account name. Premission: `renamer.self`

Rewrites `/user` command to add `/user name` subcommand.

If you need to turn the extension of the command off, you can do this in `Renamer.json`.
So you will get `/username` command with `renamer.admin` permission.
